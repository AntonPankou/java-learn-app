        And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
            Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow
            From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—
        For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—
                    Nameless here for evermore.`,
